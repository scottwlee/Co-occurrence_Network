# Co-occurrence_Network
This repository contains R scripts for constructing co-occurrence networks based on MAGs (Metagenome-Assembled Genomes) across three environmental clusters (Chemosynthetic, Coastal, and Open), using SparCC. The code performs degree centrality analysis to compare diazotrophs and non-diazotrophs under varying prevalence thresholds.
